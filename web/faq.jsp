So its advisable to drive an out state registered car with the existing registration and re-register in their own state once this rule comes into effect. Of course, keeping in mind the fact that the easiest and most economical way to drive a car is by retaining the existing registration of the car. It can later be transferred legally in the buyers name in the same state. It is registered by means of a LIC policy and registered rental deed which various RTO agents of the state facilitate in a legal bound framework accepted by the RTO."},"identifier":5188431},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does Avalon Own The Cars I See Online Or Are They Owned By The Other Individuals / Dealers?","genre":"BUYING CAR","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Avalon owns every car we sell as we don't work on park and sell facility.
